"TMIIMCAM25-EXMRNUM Batch Job Replacement – Spike Findings
Purpose
This spike analyzed the replacement of the legacy TMIIMCAM25-EXMRNUM batch job, which handled docket (case) reassignment during examiner or law office moves. The goal is to modernize this process while aligning with current systems (e.g., OKTA for employee data) and business needs.

Current Job Features
Runs during examiner switch or law office switch events.

Updates:

Employee table (EE) with new law office for examiner.

TM_LOCATION codes with the new law office code.

AM-CHRG-TO-LOC if the prefix doesn't match the new law office.

Proposed Replacement
No updates to Employee table (EE) — employee data is now managed through OKTA.

Update CURRENT_LOCATION_CD in TM_LOCATION to reflect the correct law office code.

Update TRM records to maintain worker-case relationships and examiner workload routing.

Preserve charge-to-location update logic (update prefix only if it does not match the new law office).

Business Questions for Confirmation
Should all cases be moved automatically?

Should movement depend on:

Case assignment date?

Case status? (For example, only PENDING cases)

How should co-pending dockets be handled?

Pending Status Codes Under Consideration
The following status codes have been identified as PENDING and may be eligible for transfer:

410, 616, 620, 630, 631, 638, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 663, 664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 672, 680, 681, 682, 686, 688, 689, 690, 692, 693, 694, 715, 718, 719, 720, 721, 722, 724, 725, 730, 731, 732, 733, 734, 744, 745, 746, 748, 752, 753, 756, 757, 760, 762, 763, 764, 765, 766, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 777, 779, 794, 801, 802, 803, 804, 806, 807, 808, 809, 810, 811, 812, 813, 814, 815, 816, 817, 818, 819, 820, 821, 822, 823, 824, 825

Related Scenarios Identified with O&M
The O&M team highlighted other related scenarios that could align with or be automated alongside this batch replacement:

Employee Promotions/Demotions

Update dockets to reflect new position

Update worker and related tables

New Hires

Create worker records

Set up docket routing

Terminations/Retirements

Find and reassign active cases

Ensure co-pending relationships are maintained

Apply docket dividing logic where needed

Trigger reassignment flows

Summary
The proposed replacement will modernize docket reassignment processing, align with OKTA-managed employee data, and ensure correct routing of cases through TM_LOCATION and TRM updates. Additional related scenarios may be considered for automation as part of this effort.","The purpose of this batch job replacement is to modernize the process of docket reassignment during examiner or law office moves by aligning it with current systems (e.g., OKTA for employee data) and business needs.
